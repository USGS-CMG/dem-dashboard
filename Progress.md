Today we began planing out the tools we will use to create the dashboard. A Glitter chat was setup and planned to meet on video every Monday at 1pm. We plan to setup the tools to access the data we will be working with as well as the jupyter notebook we will be using to construct everything.

The project is slowly moving along. We have successfully added a visual representation of the COG data. The option to toggle through diffrent places was also added so that the user will be able choose what data they want to look at. The programmer has to put them in manualy though. Currently working on having the dashboard display the maximum and minimum heights of the data set. Soon we will have to look into having the program somehow let the user select from the data which is in the cloud.

A lot of progress was made this week. Essentially all we have worked on was put together as one. The functions from **xarray-spatial** were added. A user can select between using **shade, quantile, slope and aspect**. A special slider has been added which allows for choosing a range of values which you would like to examine (for example all parts of the map whose height is between 40 and 200 meters). For the quantile function you can select how many levels you want to use. Unfortunalty, the curvature is presenting some problems but that will be sorted out. The user can also select the **color map** that they want to use as well.
