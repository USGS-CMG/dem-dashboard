Today we began planing out the tools we will use to create the dashboard. A Glitter chat was setup and planned to meet on video every Monday at 1pm. We plan to setup the tools to access the data we will be working with as well as the jupyter notebook we will be using to construct everything.

The project is slowly moving along. We have successfully added a visual representation of the COG data. The option to toggle through diffrent places was also added so that the user will be able choose what data they want to look at. The programmer has to put them in manualy though. Currently working on having the dashboard display the maximum and minimum heights of the data set. Soon we will have to look into having the program somehow let the user select from the data which is in the cloud.
